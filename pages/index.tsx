        After more than 8 years in financial analysis that included building
        dashboards, forecasts, and custom reports with Python scripting, I’ve
        noticed that building something, even writing a simple python script,
        was usually the most rewarding part of my job. For this reason, I’ve
        decided to focus full time on software engineering. I’ve successfully
        completed the coding Bootcamp to structure and formalize my knowledge.
        And now I’m looking for a web developer position.
